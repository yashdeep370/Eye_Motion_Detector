# Eye_Motion_Detector
An Eye Motion Detector using Python and OpenCV tracks eye movements in real-time using a webcam. It detects facial landmarks with dlib and OpenCV, identifying eye regions and monitoring their motion. The system analyzes eye aspect ratio (EAR) to detect blinks, gaze direction, or drowsiness.
